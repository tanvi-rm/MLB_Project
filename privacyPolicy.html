              </h2>
              <p class="mb-4">
                <em>In Short:</em> We aim to protect your personal information
                through a system of organisational and technical security
                measures.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
                organisational security measures designed to protect the
                security of any personal information we process. However,
                despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,
                no electronic transmission over the Internet or information
                storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we
                cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or
                other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our
                security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
                information. Although we will do our best to protect your
                personal information, transmission of personal information to
                and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only
                access the Services within a secure environment.

              </h2>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
                applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting
                you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
                data about your online browsing activities monitored and
                collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for
                recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
                other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not
                to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is
                adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
                about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
